James usually behaves, but better care would not hurt.
It's a pleasure to have James in class. He behaves well most of the time and I rarely worry.

I don't remember a time when James could do a homework or assignment on time. Change is required!
It must be emphasized that homework must be done. It's a shame that James regularly can't do his homework.
